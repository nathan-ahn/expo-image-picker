# Description

This is a fork of [`expo-image-picker`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expo-image-picker) with additional utility as required by [swsh](https://www.joinswsh.com). Feel free to use at your own risk: This is considered to be very unstable and untested for most use cases.

Due to the monstrous size of Expo, this is a fork of a subdirectory in it so we don't have to download the entire repository. [Guide for forking and updating](https://stackoverflow.com/a/24577293)
